#Top K ELements in List
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

# The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

# You may return the output in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2

# Output: [2,3]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1

# Output: [7]
# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
# -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.
